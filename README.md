# Legend Screen

This code comes from my personal project that I undertook while working as a Research Assistant in the Rubin Lab at Harvard University. It contains computational analysis of a cell surface marker screening assay, performed on Skeletal Muscle Organoids at different timepoints across culturing. The goal of this project was to analyze how populations resemble each other, and determine what markers may be available to effectively separate populations of interest via FACS. 

Tools used involve PCA + k-means clustering (factoextra), and time-based clustering (mfuzz). Ab names removed for privacy purposes. Thank you to KH for all her help. 

### Description of the assay: 
BioLegend's LEGENDScreenâ„¢ products are lyophilized, fluorophore-conjugated antibodies provided in 96-well plates for the purpose of screening cell surface molecules on your cells of interest. This kit contains 253 PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against mouse cell surface markers, plus 11 mouse, rat, and hamster Ig isotype controls. It can be used to screen cell lines and primary cells (splenocytes, bone marrow-derived cells, and cells isolated from tissues, etc.).
